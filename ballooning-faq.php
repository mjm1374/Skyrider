				<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

					<div class="storybox">

						<p><strong>RESERVATIONS:</strong><br />
							A $50 non-refundable deposit is required to secure a reservation. You can also purchase gift certificates a.k.a. "the perfect gift".We only accept cash or check.</p>

						<p><strong>NATIONWIDE CERTIFICATES:</strong><br />
							We do not have an arrangement with those "brokers" that sell nationwide flight certificates, and we cannot accept those.</p>

						<p><strong>RESCHEDULING:</strong><br />
							Ballooning is weather-dependent. Weather is subject to change. The final decision of flying is made by the pilot at the launch field. This is for your safety. If a flight has to be canceled due to weather, we will do our best to reschedule at a later time that is convenient to you.</p>


						<p><strong>CANCELLATION:</strong><br />
							If you must cancel a flight, please do so at least 48 hours in advance. We will reschedule you at no charge. For cancellations less than 48 hours before flight, we reserve the right to keep the flight deposit or charge a rescheduling fee.</p>

						<p><strong>NO ALCOHOL / NO SMOKING:</strong><br />
							Alcohol is not permitted on board, and passengers visibly intoxicated will not be allowed to board the balloon per FAA Regulation.
							SMOKING IS NOT PERMITTED NEAR THE BALLOON.</p>

						<p><strong>WAIVER:</strong><br />
							Certain risks and dangers exist which are inherent in all travel, including balloon flights. You will be requested to sign a waiver in advance of your flight.</p>

						<p><strong>HOW LONG IS A FLIGHT?</strong><br />
							We will be in the air for about an hour but the whole adventure takes about 3 hours. If the conditions are good and we can fly a bit longer, our pilot will be happy to do so. But we cannot promise a specific duration in advance - this is a pilot decision based on weather and landing spot availability.</p>

						<p><strong>HOW HIGH, HOW FAST AND HOW FAR WILL WE FLY?</strong><br />
							Usually 500 - 2000 feet above ground, but balloons can fly at treetop level or go much higher. Since balloons travel with the wind, the balloon
							will only go as fast as the wind is blowing , generally not much faster than 8-10 mph. For example, an hour-long flight with winds averaging 6 mph will travel a distance of about 6 miles.</p>

						<p><strong>HOW DO WE COME BACK?</strong><br />
							Each balloon has a ground crew that follows the path of the balloon on the ground in the chase vehicle and is in contact with the balloon via radio. The ground crew will meet the balloon at the landing spot and help to pack up the balloon. Once the balloon is all packed up, you will get a ride back in the chase vehicle.</p>

						<p><strong>PASSENGER RESTRICTIONS:</strong><br />
							Almost anyone can take a balloon ride, however passengers should be tall enough to see over the edge of the basket (about 4 feet), be able to stand for at least an hour, have no medical issues that may affect their ability to participate in light physical activity (including pregnancy).</p>

						<p><strong>WHAT TO WEAR:</strong><br />
							You should dress as you would for any outdoor activity: loose comfortable clothing with sturdy footwear. The temperature up in the balloon will be about the same as it is on the ground. Please no heeled shoes or sandals; sneakers are highly recommended.</p>

						<p><strong>WHAT TO BRING:</strong><br />
							Please bring the balloon ride confirmation page and waiver that were sent to you, as well as a photo ID. Other than that, the most important thing to bring with you is a camera and lots of film or memory! This is the best way to capture your flight experience and share it with friends and family.</p>
